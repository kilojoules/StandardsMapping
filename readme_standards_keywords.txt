General
Collaborative tables aimed to facilitate the finding of standards for any topic through the use of keywords. The existing open-source content serves as a basis to be expanded by other users increasing its value for future searches. The final goal would be to cover all standards specifying the related keywords and categories.

Content
The data present in the table can be used to build visualizations that help the user on his search through a more interactive and visual interface. An example for this would be a graph data base, where the relations are defined in the table and these are then represented in a much more visual format.

File description
Relation between standards and keywords.
One column contains the standards and the other column contains the keywords related to the standards. It would be completely normal that a standard appears in several rows with different keywords and also that one keyword appears several times relating to different standards. That is the intention of this table.

How to use it
The goal of this collaborative table is to cover the standards and facilitate the search, so the intended collaboration would just consist on adding new rows with new content at the end of the table. This implies adding the standard and the related keyword to such row. The standard might already exist in the table but the relation with the keyword should be new, in order to add value since a new relation will be built.
